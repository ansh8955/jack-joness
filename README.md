   1. What are the different tags you used (if semantic or not)

  <header>: Represents the header of a section or a page.
  <main>: Contains the main content of the document.
  <section>: Defines a section of a document.
  <footer>: Represents the footer of a section or a page.
      
2. If you used any external package like tailwind or any other
    we used font awesome icons and google font icons for that we need to paste some external or cdn links to head tag.
3. Proper screenshot of different sections you made
   I made a home page and New In page (not able to paste the screen shots here)
